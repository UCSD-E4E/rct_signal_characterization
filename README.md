# RCTSpring2017
This repo contains any and all CSE 145/237D project code utilized during UCSD's academic spring quarter 2017 to improve upon a design to track animal radio collars from autonomous drones. The following improvements will be implemented:

(1) Integrate and parse an external Ublox m8n GPS module into the payload of a new aerial platform, the 3DR Solo. 
(2) Design a new user interface for starting and stopping data logging with visual indicators of 3D GPS fix. 
(3) Emulate a radio collarâ€™s power output in various waveforms using a USRP.

This repo will push its fianal software deliverables to the main E4E Radio Collar Tracker repo: https://github.com/UCSD-E4E/radio_collar_tracker_drone. The following open source repos are used in this project:

(1) Ublox binary data parsing: https://github.com/tridgeIn/pyUblox
